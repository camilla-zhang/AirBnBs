# Visualizing NYC Airbnbs
This data story was originally an assignment for my Data Visualization course taught by Thomas Brambor in the Spring of 2022. In this assignment, I:
1. Create a stamen map, clustered leaflet map, and density heat map to show where the Airbnbs are located within NYC and which areas are the most dense areas are in terms of Airbnb count.
2. Create 2 sets of heat maps and t-maps to compare the densities of Permanent and Semi-permanent Airbnbs
3. Display a grouped bar graph that visualizes the count of Airbnbs (and type of Airbnbs) for each NYC neighborhood
4. Add an interactive data table that aggregates the Airbnbs by neighborhood, shows the count of Airbnbs, how many Airbnbs are available year round or short term, etc.
5. Show a map that allows the user to hover over each Airbnb and learn information about it (nightly price, neighborhood location, price range, rating, etc)
